There are 2 supported SDK (Node and Java)-Here we talk node

Node has 3 main modules for sdk -API,FABRIC_CLIENT,FABRIC_CA_CLIENT
API--To ommunicate with client
Fabric_client -to communicate with chaincode
fabrci_ca_client- to communicate with fabric ca server

**So first thing is writing a .js file on node js that can register users and enroll them**
Code-
var Fabric_Client = require('fabric-client');
var Fabric_CA_Client = require('fabric-ca-client');

Connect to CA Server
    fabric_ca_client = new Fabric_CA_Client('http://localhost:7054', null , '', crypto_suite);

Get current user context as we need to us him to register and enroll
    fabric_client.getUserContext('admin', true);
//Register by passing id,affliations and metadata
    return fabric_ca_client.register({enrollmentID: 'user1', affiliation: 'org1.department1'}, admin_user);

//Enroll the user with obtained passord from register ans store Ecerts,preivate key and pem files in a folder
    return fabric_ca_client.enroll({enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret});

**After above step we go into invoke**
Here there will be 4 main steps

preset-connect to peer using below command
var peer = fabric_client.newPeer('grpc://localhost:7051');


1.)Get current user certs
2.)create a request object which has peerid and channel name for invoke and just peerid for query
3.)create a transaciton id using client.gettransactionid
4.)create a event hub object to connect to peer eventhub for listening on events(3 types-bloc events,transaiction id,chain code events)
5.)regiser trasaction id from step3 to eventhun
6.)perform channel.sendtrnasactionporposal to send the request
7.)after getting prorposal broadcast the trsanction to orderer using channel.sendtransaction() 
for query we use channel.querybychaincode()
